styling:

make a text-secondary class that uses the secondary color variable

now lets make our grid

 2rem space between elements
 space inside the element top & bottom of 1.5rem

card styles
 now we want the icon on the left we can do that by making each individual card a flex container
 we'll have to overwrite some settings that are already set on the card 
 add 1rem of space on the outside of the icon
