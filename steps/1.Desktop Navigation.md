Html boiler plate & project setup:

create our boilerplate html by doing ! & enter
link the stylesheet right above the title and put a title in
import font-awesome & open-sans font right above where we linked the stylesheet

add open-sans font to the body in css

do the css reset for margin, padding and box-sizing

on the root element we're gonna set variable for custom properties which will be colors
the variables will be:
primary-color #fc5d66
secondary-color #ffc05a
light-color #f9fafb
dark-color: #272d35

add smooth scrolling to the html/body
and line height of 1.6 to both

global link styles
remove underline

unordered list styles:
remove bullets

images:
max-width to be 100% of the container

add media queries:(dont put anything inside just have them)
under 1200px

under 992px

under 768px

Desktop Navigation:
HTML
make our nav item with a class of navbar
make a div with the class of navbar-flex and container
add the logo inside
add a div with the class of main-menu-items
inside that div make a ul with the class of main-menu-list
add each item inside the list as a link (make each link go to as section that is name after the link when clicked)
put the social media icons inside of a link also

Styling

container styles:\*\*remember we want to do the padding and stuff on the container class and flex stuff on the flex class
max-width of 1200px
margin center it
0 space inside the element on the top and bottom 2 rem of space on the left and right inside the element

make the styling for a .container-sm class (that we're not using yet) copy everything from this class except the max-width should be 1000px

actual navbar styles:
make the background black (for now so we can see the text (which is white) and the logo(which is white))
text color white (won't do anything to the links)
space inside the element of 1rem top/bottom 2rem left/right
make it fixed to the top by using positioning
top,left,right of 0
we want it to stay ontop so we want to set a high z-index of 1000
we want to set a transition on the background-color for 0.3 secs to ease in and out

image styles:
make the image 81px tall 32 px wide

navbar flex styles:
along the axis we want space between the flex items
along the cross axis we want to center the flex items

ul styling:target the ul by class
make it a flex container
on the cross axis center the items
make space between each flex item of 2rem
font weight of 600

link styling: target the links
make them white
on hover make them the secondary color

icons:
make their size 1.5rem (google how to resize them if i forget)
