Our main problem is on smaller screens the menu is too wide and we cant see all the items (i can see it by making the screen smaller)

so we need to do a media query

media query for 768px make the entire menu (not just the list not display anymore)

html:
we need to make a mobile menu so we go right under the div for the main menu and make a div for the mobile menu with the class of mobile menu

we need a div for the hamburger button:
make a div with the class of mobile-menu-toggle for that
then we need to add the hamburger icon in that div with the size of 2x

we need the entire main menu so copy that and put it right below the hamburger menu

change the classnames from main to mobile cause the main-menu classes will be hidden at 768px

styling:(go right above the media queries)
when targeting the items prefix with .navbar
hamburger button:
we want to make the color of it white and make the cursor a pointer

now we will style the entire mobile mobile menu (prefix with navbar)
make the position of it absolute
top 100%
left 0
make it takeup the width of its container
background color of rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8)
give it an opacity of 0.95 to make it transparent
space inside the element on top & bottom of 3rem and left and right of 2 rem
make all the text be in the center
box shadow 0 for the horizontal 2px for the vertical 5px for the blur the color rgba(0,0,0, 0.1)
border at the top 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.1)
make the text be in the center

now we have the items positioned correctly but we may want to make the font-size bigger and add some spacing between them so we will now target the mobile list

mobile menu list styles:
make it a flex container (will line items up horizontally)
change direction of items so it's vertical
give space between each element of 2rem
make the size of the text to 1.2rem

since this is the mobile menu we have to make the entire menu hidden by default (including the hamburger icon) cause we dont want it showing on desktop we do this by targeting the entire wrapper and changing the display of it

to make the menu show we need to go to media queries 768px(where the desktop main menu will dissappear)
make the mobile menu a block level element (prefix by targeting navbar class)

make the hamburger button a block level element and give it space inside the element of 10px all around

now the menu is showing but we only want it to show when clicked and we'll do that with transform
we need to do a translateX on the entire menu of 100% to make it be off the screen

now we need to make it so that the entire menu with the class of active has no transform and that will be the way we show the menu

before we do that we can add a transition with the transform of 0.3s ease so the menu comes in smoothly

now we need to add the javascript:
add an eventlistener on the document for when the dom content is loaded and run a function
inside that function:
prefix our query selectors with .navbar
we need to make a variable for the hamburger button and call it togglebutton we get this element by using queryselector
we also need to make a variable for the mobile menu

then we need to make a click event for the hamburger button that toggles the class of active on the mobile menu when clicked
