HTML:
Go below the hero section and this is where we will start the learn section

make a section with the class of learn
make a div with the class of container
make a div for the section with the class of section-header
inside the section header:
h2 with the text of "What Will You Learn?"
div with the class of heading-border
paragraph with the text of "Embark on a journey of learning with our comprehensive video course. Discover the secrets of successful video creating and enhance your skills."
below that we will have another div with the class of topics this is where we will have our grid
inside here we will have 6 topics
each topic will have
image(wrapped in a div) alt can be topic
each image is description-1,2,3,4,5,6.jpg
div for the text with a class of topic-text:
h3

CSS
Utility classes
section header:we're gonna make this a utility class
make sure it doesn't go above 750px
center it with margin
make text be in the center
space on the bottom outside the element of 3rem

h2 that is inside of every section header
size of text 2rem
weight of font 700
color: dark variable
space on the bottom outside of the element of 0.5rem

paragraph inside every section header:

utility classes END

now we will style the topics
we use the topics class to make the grid:
we want 4 columns 1fr in size with 2rem of space between the elements

we want the images to scale up a little when hovered over
we can do that with the scale property under transform we want to scale it 1.1

we want that to be a transition of 0.3 seconds

now we want to style the h3 under every topic
size of text 1rem
weight of text 700
space outside the element top and bottom of 0.5rem and 0 space left and right

media queries:
once we hit 1200px
we want 3columsn 1fr in size
(remember the element we're targeting already has display grid so we dont need that)

once we hit 992px:
we want 2 columns

once we hit 576:
we want 1 column
