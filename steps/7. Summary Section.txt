make a section with the class of summary and id of summary for menu-click

a div with the class of container
a div with the class of section-header
h2 with the text of Course Summary
div with the class of heading-border

outside of the section heading we're gonna have a div with the class of section-lists
each list will have a div with the class of list
div with the class of list-header
div with the class of list item 3 times
we need 3 such lists

styling

entire summary section:
give it a background of light color variable which is a type of gray
text color of dark color
space inside the section 4rem top 2rem left/right 5rem bottom

now we're gonna style the section lists wrapper
white background
space inside the element 2rem all sides

list header:
background of primary color variable
color of text white
space inside the element 0.5rem top/bottom 1rem left/right
size of text 1.2rem
weight of text bold
space outside the element 1rem top/bottom 0 left/right

list item:
space inside the element top/bottom 1.4rem 0 left/right
border on the bottom of the element 1px solid #f1f4f6

on the last element we don't want a border bottom so we have to target that element

media query:on small screens there's too much spacing
576px:
we want to remove padding from the container to make everything wider
