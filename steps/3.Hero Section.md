HTML

Make a section with the actual section tag with the class of hero(we can use the header tag also)
make a div with the class of container and hero-flex
now we need to add our divs for the content and one for the image
the content div should have a class of hero-content
hero-content:
we need an h1 that says "Create your own video courses"
we need a paragraph that says: "Dive Deep into the world of creativity and learn to craft stunning videos that captivate your audience."
we need a link that says "$29 Get Course"

so right now some of the text is at the top but that's because the nav is fixed position
styling:
entire hero section wrapper:
background:
give it a color of black  
use the header background image
position of center center
background size of cover
repeat as no repeat

add space inside the element:
11.5rem ontop 2rem left/righht 8rem bottom
make color of text white
if there's any scrollbar horizontally remove it (tip:use overflow-x property)
give it a position of relative

now we want to put the text next to the image
hero flex styles:
make a flex container
put space between the flex items on the main axis
center items on the cross axis
add space of 6rem between the flex items
add space on the bottom but inside the element of 8rem

now we need to resize the text

h1:
size of h1 text as 3.5rem
space between lines of 1.2
weight of the text to 700
space on the bottom of the element outside of 1rem

p:
size of text 1.2rem
space between lines of 1.0
space on the bottom of the element on the outside of 2rem
weight of the text to 400

now lets style the image:
make it take up 100% of it's container
move it to the right 100px by using margin-left or margin right with -px

now we style the anchor tag:
put this in the utility classes as .btn
make it an inline-block element
space inside the element top/bottom of 1.6rem and left/right of 2.6rem
border of 1 px solid secondary color
border edges 32px
background secondary color
color of the text is the dark color
make the cursor be a pointer
make the transition be all in 0.2seconds

anchor tag on hover
background is primary color
color of text is white
color of the border is white

make the background of the navbar transparent so we can see through it
