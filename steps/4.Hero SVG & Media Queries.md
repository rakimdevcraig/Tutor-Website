SVG:
download the svg and add the file to an svg folder

HTML:
Add the svg to the bottom of the hero section (cause thats where we want it)

look at the svg element and it will have a class use that class to target it in the CSS
Styling:
we want to position it so it stays exactly where it's at (look up positionings)
left: we want it lined up all the way on the left side
bottom: we want it at the very bottom
width: we want it to take up the entire container
height:100px so it isn't taking up too much space

Media queries:
Once we get to 1200px the image is way too big and the space between the image and the text is too much

1200px media queries
make the space between the flex items (hero content & image) 2rem

the image:
make sure it doesnt go above 500px
and make whatever margin we set on the image in the normal styles be 0

the h1:
make it 3rem in size

992px:
Entire section:now we're gonna stack the items cause it's getting too close to each other

align all the text to the center for the entire hero section

flex container
make the main flex axis vertical (we don't have to do display flex because we're already in a flex container)
make space on the bottom inside the element of 4rem

image:
make sure it doesnt go above 600px
and space on the top outside the element of 2rem

576px:
entire section:alot of space on the outside so we can remove some of that
0.2rem on the left inside the element
0.2rem on the right inside the element

h1:
make the size of the text 2.5rem

image:
make sure it doesnt go above 350px

Navbar Background on Scroll:
problem here is as we scroll down the items from the navbar are white and when we scroll over things like the h1 which is also white we cant see the nav menu items

so we're gonna target the navbar when it has the class navbar-scroll ON it NOT IN it (put it right under the nav class)
give it a background-color of rgba(235,77,85,0.7)
add a blur effect only to the background color and not the text(main menu items) with backdrop-filter property blur(10px)

test it out to make sure its working before we add it in js

js:
add an eventlistener for the window on scroll
make a variable for the navbar
check if the scrollY property is greater than 0 (that means we scrolled)
add the navbar-scroll class to navbar
or else (which means we're at the top) remove the navbar-scroll class
